<h2>About FindThatFont!</h2>
<p>FindThatFont! is an open source tool for viewing and organizing your fonts. You can use it to
see how a certain text looks in a certain font, to compare different fonts and to
categorize all fonts on your system.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/mlagerberg/FindThatFont-">fork FindThatFont!</a> on Github.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
  	<li><span class="li-title">List fonts</span><br />
      Upon startup, FindThatFont! displays a list of all fonts, grouped in categories like
      '<i>Serif</i>', '<i>Sans serif</i>', '<i>Handwritten</i>',
      '<i>Comic</i>', etc. Using the dropdown boxes above the list you may select a
      subset of fonts to be displayed. Note that fonts may appear in more
      than one category at the same time. Select type 'Uncategorized' to see a list of fonts
      that are not yet classified. Note that you can create your own categories by selecting
      the menu item '<span class="code">Fonts &gt; Edit classes...</span>'.
      </li>
      <li><span class="li-title">Categorize fonts</span><br />
      If you have fonts that are not categorized, or fonts that are mistakenly
      miscategorized, you can correct by double clicking on the font.
      This will open the edit font list' dialog, which you can also open by selecting the menu
      '<span class="code">Fonts</span>' &gt; '<span class="code">Edit font list...</span>'
      or by pressing '<span class="code">F3</span>'. In this dialog you can select all classes
      to which you want to add the font, and you have the option to exclude the font from
      displaying in the font list and exported HTML documents.
      This option will <b>not</b> uninstall the font from you system!
      </li>
      <li><span class="li-title">Exporting and printing</span><br />
      Using the option in menu '<span class="code">File</span>' &gt;
      '<span class="code">Export as HTML...</span>' (or '<span class="code">Ctrl+S</span>'),
      you can save the generated fontlist to disk.
      This will generate a W3C-compliant web page listing the selected fonts with a preview
      of each of the fonts. You can directly print the font list by selecting
      '<span class="code">Print...</span>' in the '<span class="code">File</span>'.
      </li>
      <li><span class="li-title">Appearance</span><br />
      To change the colors of the fonts or to change the sentence used in the examples,
      move to '<span class="code">Fonts</span> &gt; <span class="code">Appearance...</span>',
      or press '<span class="code">F9</span>'. In the appearing window you can change the colors
      or enter a different preview sentence. The default sentence is "My Faxed Joke Won A Pager
      In A Cable TV Quiz Show", a sentence that contains every letter in the alphabet.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Default font categories:</h2>
<p>
    <ul id="classlist">
        [When opened in FindThatFont!, a list of all classes will appear here]
    </ul>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Compatibility:</h2>
<p>
    This program is build to run on Windows and Linux.<br />
    Note that, due to the nature of XUL, FindThatFont! can only display unicode fonts, which means that some fonts, like
    WingDings, are displayed with a default font, often Times New Roman.
</p>

<h2>Credits:</h2>
<p>
    FindThatFont! was originally made by Mathijs Lagerberg (<a href="javascript:launch('http://mlagerberg.com');" title="http://mlagerberg.com">mlagerberg.com</a>) and now <a href="https://github.com/mlagerberg/FindThatFont-">open sourced on Github</a>.<br />
    Toolbar icons are from the Silk Icon set, created by Mark James (<a href="javascript:launch('http://www.famfamfam.com');" title="http://www.famfamfam.com">www.famfamfam.com</a>).

<h2>Version history:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span class="li-title">1.0</span> &mdash;
    Many changes to the program. Best improvements: speed, threading and editable categories.
    The program is a lot faster when viewing a single category, due to the new way in which the
    fontlist is stored. Second: threading is implemented so the interface no longer locks up
    when refreshing the font list, and you can interrupt refreshing the font list by pressing
    the Escape key or the cancel button on the statusbar.
    Third improvement: categories are now editable by the user. The user can choose
    which categories to show or hide, and can change the names and descriptions and thus is able
    to create new categories.<br />
    The interface is also improved: with toolbar buttons for 'All classes',
    'favorites' and 'uncategorized items'; in the preference window the user can toggle wether or not
    to show labels on the toolbar buttons; a description of a class is showed in a tooltip on the
    classname in the list view; searching is improved to function similar to the Firefox webbrowser.<br />
    Numerous minor bugs are solved.
    </li>
    <li><span class="li-title">0.3</span> &mdash;
    Second official release. New features: option to add fonts to a shortlist of favorites, to
    enable the user to compare certain fonts more easily, and a search bar, with which users can
    find fonts by (partial) name. Reorganized menus. Solved a bug that caused fonts to appear
    in default system font when displayed in certain font size.
    </li>
    <li><span class="li-title">0.2</span> &mdash;
    First official release. Includes extension manager (and thus allows to install extensions).
    Class headers of empty classes are shown in gray. Context menu added to font list. New
    font classes defined that should better fit your needs. Tooltip appears on the font list
    that shows in which classes the font under the cursor is put. Stores fontlist.ini in profile,
    so that it is not overwritten when installing a newer version of FindThatFont!. Allows to print
    the font list directly from the program rather than exporting to HTML file first. Includes
    'check for updates' option.
    </li>
    <li><span class="li-title">0.1 Beta</span> &mdash;
    First Beta release. Exports to HTML. Supports custom colors and custom preview sentence.
    </li>
