FindThatFont!
===

FindThatFont! is a handy tool to browse fonts that are installed on your system and to classify them into over 30 different categories. By using this categorization you can find any font on your system faster than ever before.

Note: Development on FindThatFont! halted. It works nicely and is stable, but (scroll down) further development is appreciated. Anyone willing to adopt the project is welcome to do so.

The project contains an example addon (located in the /PreviewBox folder) that shows a larger preview of the selected font, as a fancy bit of Lipsum, or as a character map.

### Instructions

- If you clone the repo, you must also download XULRunner (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner) and unzip it in the /xulrunner folder. The [releases][https://github.com/monkeyinmysoup/FindThatFont-/releases] come with XULRunner included.    

### Known issues

- There's an issue with non-unicode fonts (like Wingdings) not showing in the app at all.

### Other to-dos

- The lack of OO in the Javascripts will probably make a decent programmer cry a little. Some brave soul should fix this.
- Interface could use an overhaul (although, looks quite nice already, eh?).
- There are no build scripts. On every update the following must be done manually:
  - Creating a new version requires using ResHacker on findthatfont.exe to update version number
  - Changing some boolean flags in prefs.js
  - Update version numbers in:
     - application.ini (version and build id)
     - brand.dtd
     - brand.properties (also build id)
     - findthatfont.exe
     - help.html
- App saves ini file more often than necessary. It should only save the ini file when something (either a class or a font) has been changed.
- Add better comments/documentation.
- Prepare app for localization.
- Cache entire 'All classes' xul-code, maybe even inbetween sessions.
- Add option to view fonts that are not installed. Note: using file.launch() a font file can be opened using the system font viewer, which automatically load the font into memory and allows to use it in other programs (under Windows).
- Add: install and uninstall fonts. Note: copy font file to Windows font folder, and add something to the registry (using a custom XPCOM-element).
- Still uses .ini files (old school!). Should use JSON or something more reasonable.
